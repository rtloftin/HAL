Defines the 'highway' environment, along with the associated tasks.

This environment is a three lane highway with a single exit on the
right-hand side.  The car starts in the middle lane driving forward,
while most other cars are randomly generated.  Tasks include changing
to the right and left lanes, taking the exit, and passing a car in
front of the agent's car, before returning to the center lane.
